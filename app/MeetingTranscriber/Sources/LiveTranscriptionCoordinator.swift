// MARK: - LiveTranscriptionCoordinator

/// Owns the live-transcription controller lifecycle: lazy creation against the
/// active engine, the pre-warm + re-arm observer, and installing the per-channel
/// live sinks onto a recorder.
///
/// Extracted from `AppState` as a concern-specific controller (see the AppState
/// god-class split). `AppState` keeps the shared `LiveCaptionsState` (read by the
/// caption-overlay window + RPC snapshot) and injects it here; the coordinator
/// only owns the streaming `LiveTranscriptionController` and its warm-up.
///
/// The active engine is supplied via `beginPrewarm(engineProvider:)` (called from
/// `AppState.init` after stored-property init, where the `[weak self]` engine
/// closure is valid) rather than captured at construction — so the coordinator
/// never holds an AppState back-reference. `liveEnabled` / `engineSupportsLive` /
/// `verboseDiagnostics` are settings-backed closures.
///
/// Not `@Observable` — it exposes no observable state (it drives the controller
/// + captions imperatively). It still uses `withObservationTracking` internally
/// to watch the settings keys, which works regardless of this type's annotation.
