/// Converts interleaved float32 capture buffers to mono Float32 at a fixed
/// target rate, rebuilding the underlying `AVAudioConverter` whenever the input
/// sample rate changes.
///
/// A mid-recording output-device change can renegotiate the capture rate (e.g.
/// 48 kHz → 24 kHz). Resampling every span with one rate — as the batch app
/// path historically did — time-warps every span that wasn't at that rate
/// (issue #379 "tape-stop" drift: a 24 kHz span played as 48 kHz comes out 2×
/// too fast and an octave low). Converting each buffer at the rate that was live
/// when it arrived keeps the written track at true real-time duration. Mirrors
/// the in-callback resampling `MicCaptureHandler` already does for the mic track
/// and the app module's `LiveAudioResampler` does for live captions.
///
/// Channels are folded to mono by averaging *before* the converter (matching
/// `DualSourceRecorder.downmixToMono` — `AVAudioConverter`'s own stereo→mono
/// keeps only channel 0), so the converter does pure rate conversion and a
/// channel-count change across a device swap needs no special handling.
///
/// Not thread-safe: drive it from a single serial context (the capture IOProc's
/// `writeQueue`).
